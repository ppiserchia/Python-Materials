# Python-Materials
This is a repository where I'm going to show all the notes that I'm taking through my learning process in Python. 

## ❓Why?
As a Junior Developer, I am willing to learn other programming languages.

I learnt and am continuing to learn SwiftUI and the Apple ecosystem, with its frameworks - apart from that, I want to enlarge my knowledge in language programming, by learning new ones.

## 💻 Tech 
I am currently using **Python** as the main language.

In order to take notes of every argument I am learning, I am writing them in a **Jupyter Notebook** and taking also notes in a .py file.

## 🤖 Frameworks
* **math**: A framework used to provide access to common mathematical functions.
* **NumPy**: A library that allow you working with arrays and in domain of linear algebra, complex mathematical operations.

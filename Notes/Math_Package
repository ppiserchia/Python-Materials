# We can also bypass the term ''math'' by importing the name of the package and linking it to an another name, with the ''from'' and ''import'' keywords.
from math import pi
circunference2 = 2 * pi * 3 # Now, we can use pi instead of math.pi, because we imported the name of the package and linked it to the name pi.
print(circunference2) # the result will be the same as circunference.

# We can also use the math package to calculate the square root of a number, by using math.sqrt() method.

print(radice)

# and as we did with pi, we can do the same with sqrt.
